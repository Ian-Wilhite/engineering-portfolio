\section*{Introduction}
Howdy! \\
My name is Ian Wilhite and I am a Senior in Robotics and Controls Engineering at Texas A\&M! This portfolio contains a collection of reports and presentations from my engineering courses, project teams, programs, and competitions. The pdf content can be found in the [github repository for this portfolio](https://github.com/Ian-Wilhite/engineering-portfolio/), and the start of each section leads with an overview of context, content, skills, and relevance. I would highly reccomend using the hyperlinks or ctrl-f to navigate this document. 
Thank you for taking the time to review my background, and I hope you get to meet a piece of me over the next ~500 pages.

\section{Autonomous Aerospace Systems}
\subsection*{Summary}
\textbf{Content:} Autonomous Aerospace Systems (AERO 489) is a special topics course taught by Dr. John Valasek and Dr. Daniel Selva covering state space representation, uninformed and informed search, deterministic and stochastic world modeling, Reinforcement Learning (RL) models and training methods, and cumulated in a final project in which we modeled a dynamic game and trained an RL agent to play it. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item HW1: Uninformed and Informed Search in Deterministic and Non-Deterministic Environments 
    \item HW2: First Order Logic (FOL) and Problem Structure
    \item HW3: Policy Comparison on Non-deterministic problems
    \item HW4: Q Learning - Foundations of Policy-Based RL
    \item HW5: Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Comparisons  
    \item Final Project Presentation (Incomplete)
    \item Final Project Report (Complete)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Contributors:} Ian Wilhite (Solo Course Project)

\textbf{Key Skills:} Autonomous Systems, Aerospace Engineering, Control Theory, Reinforcement Learning, Gymnasium, Stable Baselines, Python.

\textbf{Relevance:} The course highlighted the practical side of RL and ML implementation on real world systems based on system modeling, fundamental understandings, model selection, and implementation structure. The homeworks and projects provided an opporuntity to watch policies be developed.
