# engineering-portfolio

This is my engineering portfolio! I chose to use latex because it had great modular pdf-stitching for easy future scalability. This is meant to serve as a comprehensive record of all of my major projects and work, and because I was pushing the limits of free overleaf, I decided to compile the latex files locally!

Feel free to browse any of the files individually or take a look at the portfolio.tex file.
