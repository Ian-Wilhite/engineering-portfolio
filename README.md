# engineering-portfolio

This is my engineering portfolio! This is meant to serve as a comprehensive record of all of my major projects and work, and because I was pushing the limits of overleaf, I decided to compile the latex locally!

Feel free to browse any of the files individually or take a look at the latex file.
